Key changes and additions:

Modified get_person_facts function to specifically request a detailed text for audio narration.

Updated parse_gpt_response function to properly extract the text_for_audio data.

Added a new create_audio function that generates an audio file from the text_for_audio data using gTTS.

In the create_video function, we now use the text_for_audio data to create the audio for each fact.

This script now does the following:

Generates 10 facts about a person, including a title, description, and detailed text for audio narration.
Finds relevant images from Wikimedia Commons and videos from Pixabay.
Creates audio files from the text_for_audio data for each fact.
Combines the audio with either a video or image to create a clip for each fact.
Concatenates all clips into a final video.
Saves all the data (including the text_for_audio) in a JSON file.
Remember to replace 'your-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key and 'your-pixabay-api-key-here' with your Pixabay API key.
